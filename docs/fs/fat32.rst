=============
``src/fs/fat32.zig``
=============

   A read-only FAT32 driver that mounts a raw volume, walks paths, lists directories, and reads file contents over the ATA PIO driver.

What it does
============

This module mounts a raw FAT32 volume (no partition table — the whole disk is one filesystem) by parsing the boot sector/BPB into a ``BootInfo`` geometry, then provides path resolution and file reads. It follows cluster chains through the File Allocation Table (with a one-sector FAT cache), scans directories handling both short 8.3 and long file names, and streams or copies file data. All disk access goes through the ATA PIO driver; the driver is read-only.

Key components
==============

Types & state
-------------

- ``Node`` — a resolved path: starting ``cluster``, ``size``, and ``is_dir`` flag (public result type).
- ``BootInfo`` (``bi``) — geometry parsed from the boot sector plus the derived ``first_data_sector``.
- ``Entry`` — one resolved directory entry (name, first cluster, size, is_dir) passed to scan callbacks; its ``name`` is only valid for the callback's duration.
- Constants: ``SECTOR`` (512), ``EOC`` (end-of-chain marker), ``ATTR_DIRECTORY``, ``ATTR_VOLUME_ID``, ``ATTR_LFN``.

Mount & helpers
---------------

- ``mount()`` — reads and validates the boot sector (signature, sector size, FAT32-ness), fills ``bi``, invalidates the FAT cache, and sets ``mounted``. Safe with no/unformatted disk (logs why and returns false).
- ``isMounted()`` — whether a volume is currently mounted.
- ``rd16`` / ``rd32`` — little-endian field readers for FAT structures.
- ``nextCluster(cluster)`` — FAT lookup for the next cluster in a chain, backed by the single-sector ``fat_cache``.
- ``clusterToSector(c)`` / ``isDataCluster(c)`` — cluster-to-LBA mapping and in-use-cluster test.

Directory scanning & names
--------------------------

- ``scanDir(start_cluster, ctx, onEntry)`` — walks every entry in a directory's cluster chain, assembling long names and invoking the comptime callback per real entry (callback returns true to stop early).
- ``accumulateLfn(...)`` — folds one ``ATTR_LFN`` entry's 13 UTF-16 chars into the assembly buffer at its sequenced slot (ASCII rendered, non-ASCII → ``?``).
- ``shortName(...)`` — renders an 8.3 name (``"FOO     TXT"`` → ``"FOO.TXT"``), honoring the Windows/NT base/extension lowercase flags at offset 0x0C.
- ``LFN_OFFSETS`` — the scattered byte offsets of the 13 LFN chars within a 32-byte entry.

Path resolution & operations
----------------------------

- ``resolve(path)`` — resolves an absolute path (e.g. ``/docs/notes.txt``) to a ``Node``, walking each ``/``-separated component from the root; null if any component is missing.
- ``findInDir`` / ``findCallback`` / ``FindCtx`` — case-insensitive lookup of a single name within a directory.
- ``ls(path)`` — list a directory (or print a single file's size).
- ``cat(path)`` — stream a file's contents to serial (shell ``cat``).
- ``readFile(path, dst)`` — read a whole file into a caller buffer; returns bytes read, or null on error / buffer too small.
- ``selfTest()`` — mounts, lists ``/``, and ``cat``s ``/HELLO.TXT`` to exercise the full read path.

Depends on / used by
====================

- **Imports:** ``std``, ``drivers/serial.zig`` (logging/output), ``drivers/ata.zig`` (sector reads + presence check).
- **Used by:** the shell's ``ls`` / ``cat`` commands; ``readFile`` is the primitive a future milestone (loading an init binary) will build on; ``selfTest`` runs during boot bring-up.

Notes
=====

- Read-only: there are no write/allocate paths.
- Only 512-byte-sector disks are supported (``mount`` rejects others).
- Assumes a raw FAT32 volume with no partition table — sector 0 is the boot sector itself.
- The FAT cache (``fat_cache_sector``/``fat_cache``) makes walking a chain that stays within one FAT sector free after the first lookup; ``mount`` must invalidate it per volume.
- FAT names are matched case-insensitively (``eqlIgnoreCase``); long names take precedence over the 8.3 name when present.
- A FAT read error is treated as end-of-chain (``EOC``) to stop a chain safely rather than loop.
